## Introduction
Word embeddings play a crucial role in natural language processing tasks such as language modeling, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval. The CBOW algorithm learns word embeddings by predicting a target word based on its surrounding context words. It assumes that words appearing in similar contexts have similar meanings. By capturing these contextual relationships, CBOW creates dense vector representations that encode semantic information about words.

This repository provides a step-by-step implementation of the CBOW algorithm using PyTorch. It includes data preparation, model architecture, training, evaluation, and inference functionalities. Additionally, it allows for visualizing the learned word embeddings using PCA.



## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the CBOW implementation:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib


## Overview
The CBOW implementation follows the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: The provided code includes a sample corpus for demonstration purposes. You can replace it with your own corpus. The corpus is split into context-target word pairs.

2. **Word Vocabulary**: The unique words in the corpus are used to create a vocabulary. Each word is assigned a unique index, which serves as its identifier.

3. **Model Architecture**: The CBOW model is defined using PyTorch. It consists of an input layer, a hidden layer (word embedding layer), and an output layer. The hidden layer learns the word embeddings.

4. **Training**: The CBOW model is trained using the corpus. During training, the model predicts the target word from the context words and updates its parameters using gradient descent and backpropagation.

5. **Evaluation**: The implementation includes a simple evaluation metric to measure the model's performance. It calculates the loss and accuracy during training.

6. **Inference**: After training, you can input a text and observe the predicted word based on the provided context words.

7. **Word Embedding Visualization**: The implementation allows you to visualize the word embeddings using PCA. It projects the high-dimensional embeddings onto a 2D space for visualization purposes.

# Sequence-to-Sequence Learning Using Neural Networks

This repository contains an implementation of the Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model for sequence learning using neural networks. The Seq2Seq model has gained significant popularity in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and dialogue generation.

## Introduction
The Seq2Seq model is a neural network architecture that aims to map an input sequence to an output sequence of potentially different lengths. It consists of two main components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes the input sequence and captures its semantic information in a fixed-length vector, also known as the context vector. The decoder then uses the context vector to generate the output sequence step by step.

This repository provides an implementation of the Seq2Seq model using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. The code is based on the seminal paper "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks" by Ilya Sutskever et al.



## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the Seq2Seq implementation:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy



## Overview
The Seq2Seq implementation follows these steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: The provided code includes functionality to preprocess the data for training the Seq2Seq model. You can customize this part according to your specific task and dataset. The preprocessing may involve tokenization, numerical encoding, and data splitting.

2. **Model Architecture**: The Seq2Seq model architecture is implemented according to the paper's specifications. It consists of an encoder and a decoder, both of which can be customized to suit your needs. The encoder typically uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as LSTM or GRU, while the decoder can be a simple RNN or have an attention mechanism.

The example code includes the following model architecture:
```



Seq2Seq(
(encoder): Encoder(
(embedding): Embedding(vocab_size_encoder, embedding_dim)
(rnn): LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_size, num_layers=num_layers, dropout=dropout)
(dropout): Dropout(p=dropout)
)
(decoder): Decoder(
(embedding): Embedding(vocab_size_decoder, embedding_dim)
(rnn): LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_size, num_layers=num_layers, dropout=dropout)
(fc): Linear(hidden_size, vocab_size_decoder)
(dropout): Dropout(p=dropout)
)
)

```


Here, the encoder and decoder components are instantiated with an embedding layer, an RNN layer (LSTM in this case), and dropout layers for regularization. The dimensions and sizes of the layers can be adjusted based on your requirements.

3. **Training**: The Seq2Seq model is trained using the prepared data. During training, the encoder processes the input sequence, and the decoder generates the output sequence based on the encoded context vector. The model parameters are updated using backpropagation and optimization algorithms such as Adam or RMSprop.

4. **Evaluation**: The implementation includes evaluation metrics to measure the performance of the Seq2Seq model. Common metrics like BLEU score or ROUGE score can be used, depending on the specific task. Evaluation can be performed during or after the training process to monitor the model's progress and performance.

5. **Inference**: After training, you can use the trained Seq2Seq model to generate output sequences for new input data. The implementation provides functionality for both single example and batch inference. The decoder can use various decoding techniques such as greedy decoding or beam search to generate the output sequence.
