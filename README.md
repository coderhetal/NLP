# CBOW IMPLEMENTATION 

This repository contains an implementation of the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) algorithm using PyTorch. CBOW is a popular algorithm for training word embeddings, which are continuous vector representations of words.

## Introduction
Word embeddings play a crucial role in natural language processing tasks such as language modeling, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval. The CBOW algorithm learns word embeddings by predicting a target word based on its surrounding context words. It assumes that words appearing in similar contexts have similar meanings. By capturing these contextual relationships, CBOW creates dense vector representations that encode semantic information about words.

This repository provides a step-by-step implementation of the CBOW algorithm using PyTorch. It includes data preparation, model architecture, training, evaluation, and inference functionalities. Additionally, it allows for visualizing the learned word embeddings using PCA.



## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the CBOW implementation:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib


## Overview
The CBOW implementation follows the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: The provided code includes a sample corpus for demonstration purposes. You can replace it with your own corpus. The corpus is split into context-target word pairs.

2. **Word Vocabulary**: The unique words in the corpus are used to create a vocabulary. Each word is assigned a unique index, which serves as its identifier.

3. **Model Architecture**: The CBOW model is defined using PyTorch. It consists of an input layer, a hidden layer (word embedding layer), and an output layer. The hidden layer learns the word embeddings.

4. **Training**: The CBOW model is trained using the corpus. During training, the model predicts the target word from the context words and updates its parameters using gradient descent and backpropagation.

5. **Evaluation**: The implementation includes a simple evaluation metric to measure the model's performance. It calculates the loss and accuracy during training.

6. **Inference**: After training, you can input a text and observe the predicted word based on the provided context words.

7. **Word Embedding Visualization**: The implementation allows you to visualize the word embeddings using PCA. It projects the high-dimensional embeddings onto a 2D space for visualization purposes.
